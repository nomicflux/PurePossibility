## Pure Possibility

Alpha version at https://nomicflux.github.io/PurePossibility/

Modal logic visualizer in Purescript.  The idea is that a user would be able to create a fishtank of various "worlds", draw relations between them, choose a system (S5, S2.5, etc.), input some propositions, then watch how the propositions flow through the worlds.

This could be extended to relevance logic as well.
